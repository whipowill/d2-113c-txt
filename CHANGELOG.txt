Fixed 1.13c TXT Files
Version 1.00
By Count.Dracula


What is this?
Fix several bugs and extend some files based on the original v1.13c TXT.
This set of TXTs will not be perfectly compatible with D2 1.10x - 1.12x.


DISCLAIMER:
I do not take any credits for making this set of fixed TXT files, since I made it with the help of Nefarius's Fixed v1.11b TXT files.
Some of the bugs present in v1.11b are already fixed in v1.13c.
